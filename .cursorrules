# Git Commit Message Guidelines
*   Commit messages should be short and to the point
*   Limit commit messages to a maximum of four sentences
*   Limit commit messages to a maximum of four bullet points. Use bullet points sparingly for key details if needed
*   Focus on clarity: Convey the essential information about the change
# React Native Development Guidelines
*   Build React Native applications using modern TypeScript patterns and best practices
*   Utilize NativeWind/TailwindCSS for consistent styling across the application
    -   Follow utility-first approach with TailwindCSS classes
    -   Maintain theme configuration in `tailwind.config.js`
    -   Use custom font families defined in the theme extension
*   State Management with Zustand
    -   Create separate store files for different domains (e.g., `profile.store.ts`)
    -   Follow immutable state patterns when updating store values
    -   Initialize stores asynchronously when needed (e.g., on app load)
    -   Use TypeScript interfaces to define store state and actions
*   Project Structure
    -   Organize components in feature-based directories
    -   Keep screens/pages in dedicated directories
    -   Maintain reusable components in a shared components folder
    -   Follow consistent naming conventions for files and components
*   Performance Considerations
    -   Implement proper memo usage for expensive components
    -   Lazy load components and screens when appropriate
    -   Optimize image assets and use proper caching strategies
    -   Monitor and minimize bundle size
